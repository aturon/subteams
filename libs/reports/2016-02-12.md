# Subteam report: libs 2016-02-12

## Highlights

We had a busy week!

RFC decisions:

- [FCP PR #1415](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1415):
  RFC: Deprecate type aliases in std::os::*::raw
  - Merged, [after a careful analysis of the breakage](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1415#issuecomment-180645582)

- [FCP PR #1353](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1353):
  Add retain_mut to Vec and VecDeque
  - Punted for another week, due to missing several relevant team members.

We are moving a large number of RFCs into **final comment period**:

- [FCP PR #1218](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1218):
  RFC: Checked integer conversions
  - This RFC has stalled to some degree, but covers important ground; please help us finalize the design!
- [FCP PR #1258](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1258):
  Add macros to get the values of configuration flags
- [FCP PR #1353](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1353):
  Add retain_mut to Vec and VecDeque
  - We're close on this one, modulo bikeshedding on the final name.
- [FCP PR #1393](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1393):
  Expand `try!` macro with additional case
  - This RFC and the next both touch on the `try!` macro, and we
    likely want to postpone action here now that the
    [`?`/`catch` RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/243) has
    been merged.
- [FCP PR #1394](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1394):
  Add `maybe!` macro equivalent to `try!`
- [FCP PR #1419](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1419):
  Safe memcpy for slices ([T]::copy_from)
  - Some discussion about
    [`Copy` vs `Clone`](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/assuming-clone-clone-is-equivalent-to-copy-semantics-for-all-instances-of-copy/3148?)
    that could potentially change the situation for this RFC.
- [FCP PR #1443](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1443):
  Extend atomic compare_and_swap
- [FCP PR #1461](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1461):
  Move some net2 functionality into libstd
  - We've had no feedback here in a month -- please take a look!
- [FCP PR #1467](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1467):
  Stabilize volatile read and write

We also reached a few decision on outstanding PRs and issues, as usual.
